# MINTR-VR
We are planning to create an online 3D-VR game (base idea of
minecraft) using React along with its dependencies such as React
fibre and React Drei. We will integrate the game with a locally
created NFT marketplace which will work on blockchainâ€™s Binance
smart testing Network. Players would be allowed to buy/sell NFTs of their
choice.

path:-All source code and the dataset used for this project are organized and stored in the master branch of this repository.
