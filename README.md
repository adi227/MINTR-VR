We are planning to create an online 3D-VR game (base idea of
minecraft) using React along with its dependencies such as React
fibre and React Drei. We will integrate the game with a locally
created NFT marketplace which will work on blockchainâ€™s ethereum
smart contract. Players would be allowed to buy/sell NFTs of their
choice.
The game, if created successfully, could be proved to be a great way
of social interaction. The game could be played directly through
browser without any need of high-end wifi. Hence, interacting with a
greater number of audience.

path:-cd mintr cd game npm install
#npm start
#cd studio sanity start
#(new terminal)yarn dev

Player's Control:
Use:
W:To move forward
S:To move backward
D:To move right
A:To move left
